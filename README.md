- using JQuery

This simple To-Do-List was created as an exercise to utilise JQuery instead of Vanilla Js.

- Outline

This app was developed as a quick exercise on how to use JQuery. It allows the things a to-do-list generally allows. Namely: Adding items to the list, removing items from the list. It really is just what it is.
